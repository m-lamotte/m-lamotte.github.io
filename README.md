Personal startpage

https://m-lamotte.github.io/

Previously this was a 'personal portfolio website', but I was ultimately unhappy with it and so I decided to turn it into a simple startpage that I'll just continue to modify and add to as time goes on; something of a simple sandbox for basic front-end, really.
