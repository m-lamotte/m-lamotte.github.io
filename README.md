Personal website

TODO:

- Update personal logo and shrink element container size to fit logo size.
- Add images to the title screen... consider something simpler than your previous ideation.
- Add self-portrait beside description in 'About' section, refactor relevant media queries.
- Potentially have some kind of an animation/transition for the self-portrait.
- Get a real domain name and upload the website so that you can make it dynamic (add PHP, for example).
- For the future, add a 'Contact' section that will include a form in PHP.
- Change the 'Portfolio' section boxes, make the CSS a bit more modern.
