        <p>
            My passion for technology started at a early age - from troubleshooting issues in MS-DOS with my father to using the terminal of a Commodore 64 for the first time in one of the school portables. This developed concurrently with an obsession with gaming, leading to an interest in hardware and building computers.<br></br>
    
            Eventually, I became enthralled by the study of philosophy and literature, with a special interest in philosophy of mind, ethics, and modernism, thus forming the basis of my undegraduate studies. Years later, I was compelled to start programming.<br></br>
            
            I'm currently finishing up a post-bacc graduate diploma in computer science while studying web development and UX in my spare time. I also like to try my hand at a few algorithms, here and there.<br><br>
    
            For a concise overview of my qualifications, you can get my resume <a href="https://nlamo.github.io/Nicholas_LaMothe_CV.pdf">here</a>.
    
            Feel free to send me an e-mail if you have any questions, or if you'd just like to have a chat.<br></br>
