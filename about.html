    <section class ="about-section">
        I've always been passionate about technology. This started at a very young age - from troubleshooting issues in MS-DOS with my father to using the terminal of a Commodore 64 for the very first time in one of the school portables. My interest in computers developed concurrently with an obsession with gaming, which led to an interest in hardware and building computer systems.<br></br>
    
        Eventually, I became enthralled by the study of philosophy and literature, with a special interest in philosophy of mind, ethics, and modernist literature. Years later, I was compelled to start programming. This pursuit, combined with a lifelong pastime of illustration, has led me to the intersection of software development and design.<br></br>
        
        As it stands, I'm currently finishing up a postbaccalaureate graduate diploma in computer science at Concordia University, working as a data annotator for an AI company, and spending a good amount of my free time studying UX design and web development. I also like to try my hand at a few algorithms, here and there.<br><br>

        If you'd like to have a concise overview of my qualifications, you can find my resume <a href="https://nlamo.github.io/Nicholas_LaMothe_CV.pdf">here</a>.

        Feel free to send me an e-mail if you have any questions, or if you'd just like to have a chat.<br></br>

        Until then,<br>
        NL
