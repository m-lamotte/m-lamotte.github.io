    <section id ="about-section">
        Originally coming from a background in the study of philosophy and English literature, I've always been passionate about technology. These interests, combined with a lifelong pastime of illustration, have let me to the intersection of programming and design.<br></br>
        
        As it stands, I'm currently finishing up a postbaccalaureate graduate diploma in computer science at Concordia University, working as a data annotator for an AI company, and spending a good amount of my free time learning web development and UX design.<br><br>

        Whenever possible, I try to keep my brain sharp by trying my hand at a few algorithms, too. (And I stay active by cycling and running!) <br></br>

        If you'd like to have a concise overview of my qualifications, you can find my resume <a href="https://nlamo.github.io/Nicholas_LaMothe_CV.pdf">here</a>.

        Feel free to send me an e-mail if you have any questions, or if you'd just like to have a chat.<br></br>

        Until then,<br>
        NL
